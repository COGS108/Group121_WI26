Normal values for healthy individuals range from 70 to 100 mg/dL.  Values 100-125 are prediabetic and values >125mg/dL indicate diabetes. Values <70 indicate hypoglycemia. Fasting idicates the patient hasn't eaten in the last 8 hours.  If blood glucose is >250 or <50 at any time (regardless of the time of last meal) the patient's life may be in immediate danger\"\n",
    "   2. If there are any major concerns with the dataset, describe them. For example \"Dataset is composed of people who are serious enough about eating healthy that they voluntarily downloaded an app dedicated to tracking their eating patterns. This sample is likely biased because of that self-selection. These people own smartphones and may be healthier and may have more disposable income than the average person.  Those who voluntarily log conscientiously and for long amounts of time are also likely even more interested in health than those who download the app and only log a bit before getting tired of it\"\n",

    "    1. load the dataset \n",
    "    2. make the dataset tidy or demonstrate that it was already tidy\n",
    "    3. demonstrate the size of the dataset\n",
    "    4. find out how much data is missing, where its missing, and if its missing at random or seems to have any systematic relationships in its missingness\n",
    "    5. find and flag any outliers or suspicious entries\n",
    "    6. clean the data or demonstrate that it was already clean.  You may choose how to deal with missingness (dropna of fillna... how='any' or 'all') and you should justify your choice in some way\n",
    "    7. You will load raw data from `data/00-raw/`, you will (optionally) write intermediate stages of your work to `data/01-interim` and you will write the final fully wrangled version of your data to `data/02-processed`\n",
    "4. Optionally you can also show some summary statistics for variables that you think are important to the project\n",

    "\n",
    "### A. Data Collection\n",
    " - [X] **A.1 Informed consent**: If there are human subjects, have they given informed consent, where subjects affirmatively opt-in and have a clear understanding of the data uses to which they consent?\n",
    "\n",
    "> Example of how to use the checkbox, and also of how you can put in a short paragraph that discusses the way this checklist item affects your project.  Remove this paragraph and the X in the checkbox before you fill this out for your project\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **A.2 Collection bias**: Have we considered sources of bias that could be introduced during data collection and survey design and taken steps to mitigate those?\n",
    "> We are concerned that the data itself may be biased or incomplete. Not all entry-level software engineering jobs are posted online, since some people get jobs through referrals, internal hiring, or campus recruiting that does not appear on job boards. Because of this, it is difficult to collect data that fully represents the true number of available jobs, which may affect the accuracy of the comparison.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [ ] **A.3 Limit PII exposure**: Have we considered ways to minimize exposure of personally identifiable information (PII) for example through anonymization or not collecting information that isn't relevant for analysis?\n",
    " - [ ] **A.4 Downstream bias mitigation**: Have we considered ways to enable testing downstream results for biased outcomes (e.g., collecting data on protected group status like race or gender)?\n",
    "\n",
    "### B. Data Storage\n",
    " - [X] **B.1 Data security**: Do we have a plan to protect and secure data (e.g., encryption at rest and in transit, access controls on internal users and third parties, access logs, and up-to-date software)?\n",
    "> The data used in this project is publicly available and does not include any private information. It is stored locally during the analysis, and basic care is taken to avoid accidentally changing or sharing the files. Because the data is low risk, no special security measures are needed.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [ ] **B.2 Right to be forgotten**: Do we have a mechanism through which an individual can request their personal information be removed?\n",
    " - [ ] **B.3 Data retention plan**: Is there a schedule or plan to delete the data after it is no longer needed?\n",
    "\n",
    "### C. Analysis\n",
    " - [X] **C.1 Missing perspectives**: Have we sought to address blindspots in the analysis through engagement with relevant stakeholders (e.g., checking assumptions and discussing implications with affected communities and subject matter experts)?\n",
    "> This project looks at overall numbers and trends, so it does not include personal experiences from recent graduates or employers. Because of this, the results may not fully explain why certain trends happen, and they should be understood as showing general patterns rather than individual experiences.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **C.2 Dataset bias**: Have we examined the data for possible sources of bias and taken steps to mitigate or address these biases (e.g., stereotype perpetuation, confirmation bias, imbalanced classes, or omitted confounding variables)?\n",
    "> The datasets used in this analysis may introduce bias because they rely on broad categories and assumptions. Not all Computer Science graduates are looking for software engineering jobs, and not all jobs labeled as “entry-level” are actually accessible to new graduates. These mismatches can affect the comparison between supply and demand, so the results should be interpreted as approximate trends rather than exact measurements.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **C.3 Honest representation**: Are our visualizations, summary statistics, and reports designed to honestly represent the underlying data?\n",
    "> The results are presented in a way that avoids oversimplifying or exaggerating the data. Instead of focusing on single-year changes, the analysis looks at overall trends across multiple years to reduce the impact of short-term fluctuations. All figures and summaries are explained in context so readers understand what the data shows and what it does not show.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [ ] **C.4 Privacy in analysis**: Have we ensured that data with PII are not used or displayed unless necessary for the analysis?\n",
    " - [X] **C.5 Auditability**: Is the process of generating the analysis well documented and reproducible if we discover issues in the future?\n",
    "> The steps of the analysis, including data sources and processing methods, are documented so that the work can be checked or repeated by others if needed, which also helps maintain transparency and accountability.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### D. Modeling\n",
    " - [ ] **D.1 Proxy discrimination**: Have we ensured that the model does not rely on variables or proxies for variables that are unfairly discriminatory?\n",
    " - [ ] **D.2 Fairness across groups**: Have we tested model results for fairness with respect to different affected groups (e.g., tested for disparate error rates)?\n",
    " - [X] **D.3 Metric selection**: Have we considered the effects of optimizing for our defined metrics and considered additional metrics?\n",
    "> The metrics used, such as the number of graduates and the number of entry-level job postings, were chosen because they directly relate to the research question. However, these metrics do not capture job quality or underemployment, which is a limitation.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [ ] **D.4 Explainability**: Can we explain in understandable terms a decision the model made in cases where a justification is needed?\n",
    " - [X] **D.5 Communicate limitations**: Have we communicated the shortcomings, limitations, and biases of the model to relevant stakeholders in ways that can be generally understood?\n",
    "> The final results clearly explain the limitations of the analysis, including data gaps and simplifying assumptions, so readers understand what the results do and do not show.\n",
    "\n",
    "### E. Deployment\n",
    " - [X] **E.1 Monitoring and evaluation**: Do we have a clear plan to monitor the model and its impacts after it is deployed (e.g., performance monitoring, regular audit of sample predictions, human review of high-stakes decisions, reviewing downstream impacts of errors or low-confidence decisions, testing for concept drift)?\n",
    "> This analysis is based on data from a specific time period. If it were updated in the future, the data and methods would need to be checked again to make sure they still reflect current job market conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [ ] **E.2 Redress**: Have we discussed with our organization a plan for response if users are harmed by the results (e.g., how does the data science team evaluate these cases and update analysis and models to prevent future harm)?\n",
    " - [ ] **E.3 Roll back**: Is there a way to turn off or roll back the model in production if necessary?\n",
    " - [X] **E.4 Unintended use**: Have we taken steps to identify and prevent unintended uses and abuse of the model and do we have a plan to monitor these once the model is deployed?\n",
    "> There is a possibility that the results could be misunderstood or used to discourage students from majoring in Computer Science. To reduce this risk, the analysis emphasizes that it describes overall trends in the job market and does not predict individual outcomes or career success.\n"

    "* *For major project decisions, we will aim for consensus. Otherwise, by majority vote. If in cases of time-sensitive decisions, the member will have to make a temporary decision at the moment and inform the group*\n",
    "* *Tasks will be divided based on individual choices as they want. We will track tasks and progress using a shared document, so responsibilities and deadlines are visible to everyone.*\n",
    "* *We will follow the agreed-upon project timeline and update it as needed. Team members are expected to complete assigned tasks by internal deadlines so the group can double-check.*\n",
    "* *If a team member is struggling to complete a task, they should notify the group as early as possible, so we can work together to redistribute work temporarily or provide support. If a member consistently misses deadlines without communication, the group will address the issue directly and follow course guidelines if needed.*\n",
    "* *All team members are expected to contribute equally in effort, communicate regularly, and respect each other’s time and commitments. We recognize that everyone has different strengths, schedules, and working styles, and we will support one another to ensure the project progresses smoothly.*"
